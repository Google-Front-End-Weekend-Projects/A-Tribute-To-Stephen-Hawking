    <h1>Books by Stephen Hawking</h1>
    <p id="intro">
        Professor Stephen Hawking had the knack to make books on challenging scientific topics and make the readers fall for his perception about the universe.

            <h2>My Brief History</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/671989.jpg" alt="my-brief-history-cover-image" />
            <p>My Brief History recounts Stephen Hawking’s improbable journey, from his post-war London boyhood to his years of international acclaim and celebrity. Illustrated with rarely seen photographs, this concise, witty and candid account introduces readers to the inquisitive schoolboy whose classmates nicknamed him ‘Einstein’; the jokester who once placed a bet with a colleague over the existence of a black hole; and the young husband and father striving to gain a foothold in the world of academia.</p>

            <h2>The Grand Design</h2>
            <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UfvNQsMgL.jpg" alt="the grand design cover page">
            <p>When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent ‘grand design’ of our universe evidence for a benevolent creator who set things in motion? Or does science offer another explanation? In The Grand Design, the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe is presented in language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. </p>

            <h2>A Brief History of Time</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/brief-history-pb5-thumb_orig.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Was there a beginning of time? Could time run backwards? Is the universe infinite or does it have boundaries? These are just some of the questions considered in an internationally acclaimed masterpiece by one of the world's greatest thinkers. It begins by reviewing the great theories of the cosmos from Newton to Einstein, before delving into the secrets which still lie at the heart of space and time, from the Big Bang to black holes, via spiral galaxies and strong theory. </p>

            <h2>A Briefer History of Time</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/3240300.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Although “briefer,” this book is much more than a mere explanation of Hawking’s earlier work. A Briefer History of Time both clarifies and expands on the great subjects of the original, and records the latest developments in the field—from string theory to the search for a unified theory of all the forces of physics. Thirty-seven full-color illustrations enhance the text and make A Briefer History of Time an exhilarating and must-have addition in its own right to the great literature of science and ideas.</p>

            <h2>Black Holes: The Reith lectures</h2>
            <img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464946995l/29537175.jpg" alt="">
            <p>“It is said that fact is sometimes stranger than fiction, and nowhere is that more true than in the case of black holes. Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science fiction writers.” In 2016 Professor Stephen Hawking delivered the BBC Reith Lectures on a subject that has fascinated him for decades – black holes. In these flagship lectures the legendary physicist argues that if we could only understand black holes and how they challenge the very nature of space and time, we could unlock the secrets of the universe.</p>

            <h2>George and the Blue Moon</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/george-and-the-blue-moon.jpg?164" alt="">
            <p> In Stephen and Lucy Hawking's latest book for children, "George and the Blue Moon", George and Annie, set out to solve a mystery set on one of the cosmic waterworlds of space. Is there life under the icy crust? Where did those robots come from and who is controlling them? Meanwhile, our two young heroes win places on a Mars training programme which has a dangerous and unexpected twist. Suddenly, the best friends find themselves fighting for survival in what feels like the Hunger Games set on the red planet. Packed with space facts and essays from leading scientists, it is our most unpredictable thriller so far!</p>

            <h2>George and the Unbreakable Code</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/george-and-the-unbreakable-code.jpg?163" alt="">
            <p>Stephen and Lucy Hawking's fourth book about the adventures of George and Annie. Just as thrilling a book as all the ones before it, George and the Unbreakable Code also delves deeper and covers topics and ideas that the intended readers might not normally think about. Overall, a brilliant book as always brought from the fabulous Hawking duo.</p>

        <div class="book">
            <h2>George and the Big Bang</h2>

            <p>The first in a series of children's books that melds cosmology and adventure, co-authored by Professor Hawking and his daughter Lucy. George's best friend Annie needs help. Her scientist father, Eric, is working on a space project - and it's all going wrong. A robot has landed on Mars, but is behaving very oddly. And now Annie has discovered something weird on her dad's super-computer...</p>

            <h2>The Universe in a Nutshell</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/2607173.gif?149" alt="">
            <p>In 200 highly illustrated pages, Hawking is pushing the frontiers of popular physics beyond relativity and quantum theory, past superstring theory and imaginary time, into a dizzying new world of M-theory and branes.</p>

        <div class="book">
            <h2>Black Holes and Baby Universes</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/black-holes-and-baby-universes-thumbnail.jpg" alt="">
            <p>In his first collection of essays and other pieces - on subjects that range from warmly personal to the wholly scientific- Stephen Hawking is revealed variously as the scientist, the man, the concerned world citizen, and - as always - the rigorous and imaginative thinker.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="book">
            <h2>On the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/9584543.jpg?151" alt="">
            <p>On the Shoulders of Giants tells a compelling story, using original papers from Einstein, Copernicus, Galilei, Kepler and Newton. Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking explains how these works changed the course of science, ushering astronomy and physics out of the Middle Ages and into the modern world. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="book">
            <h2>The Large Scale Structure of Space-time</h2>
            <img src="http://www.hawking.org.uk/uploads/1/2/2/1/12210141/4030092.jpg?153" alt="">
            <p>A textbook for Physicists, this 1973 book explores two predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity: first, that the ultimate destiny of many massive stars is to undergo gravitational collapse and to disappear from view, leaving behind a 'black hole' in space; and secondly, that there will exist singularities in space-time itself. </p>

        <div class="book">
            <h2>God created the Integers</h2>

            <p>
                God Created The Integersis Stephen Hawking's personal choice of the greatest mathematical works in history. The book includes landmark discoveries spanning 2500 years and representing the work of mathematicians such as Euclid, Georg Cantor, Kurt Godel, Augustin Cauchy, Bernard Riemann and Alan Turing.
