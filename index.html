                    <p>Professor Stephen William Hawking was born on 8th January 1942 (exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo) in Oxford, England. His parents' house was in north London but during the second world war Oxford was considered a safer place to have babies. When he was eight his family moved to St. Albans, a town about 20 miles north of London. At the age of eleven, Stephen went to St. Albans School and then on to University College, Oxford (1952); his father's old college. Stephen wanted to study mathematics although his father would have preferred medicine. Mathematics was not available at University College, so he pursued physics instead. After three years and not very much work, he was awarded a first class honours degree in natural science.

Stephen wanted to study mathematics although his father would have preferred medicine. Mathematics was not available at University College, so he pursued physics instead. After three years and not very much work, he was awarded a first class honours degree in natural science.

                        <p>In October 1962, Stephen arrived at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge to do research in cosmology, there being no-one working in that area in Oxford at the time. His supervisor was Dennis Sciama, although he had hoped to get Fred Hoyle who was working in Cambridge. After gaining his PhD (1965) with his thesis titled 'Properties of Expanding Universes', he became, first, a research fellow (1965) then Fellow for Distinction in Science (1969) at Gonville & Caius college. In 1966 he won the Adams Prize for his essay 'Singularities and the Geometry of Space-time'. Stephen moved to the Institute of Astronomy (1968), later moving back to DAMTP (1973), employed as a research assistant, and published his first academic book, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time, with George Ellis. During the next few years, Stephen was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (1974) and Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology (1974). He became a Reader in Gravitational Physics at DAMTP (1975), progressing to Professor of Gravitational Physics (1977). He then held the position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (1979-2009). The chair was founded in 1663 with money left in the will of the Reverend Henry Lucas who had been the Member of Parliament for the University. It was first held by Isaac Barrow and then in 1669 by Isaac Newton. From 2009, Stephen was employed as the Dennis Stanton Avery and Sally Tsui Wong-Avery Director of Research at DAMTP. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">I realize the thing that maybe most of us are blessed with healthy body & mind conditions but we still treat us as disable. Sometimes we become so helpless & give-up in front of the challenges we face in our personal, social or professional lives. We break down and give up on small things which are actually just pretty small in front of the purpose we carry for our life. And this man, Sir Stephen Hawking, his courage, outlook & willpower are the things that made him different than every other human being on this universe. A physically disabled man like him has contributions to theoretical physics comparable to those of Albert Einstein. Just think if a person like him can add so much to world & live meaningful life, why can’t we? It’s only willpower and positive outlook which can change our condition. Yes, it may take time but it will change for sure! So we should always try to be positive, inspirational and no matter who we are, what we are, how much we're capable or incapable we think we are, we should never give up. Instead we should get up, wipe our tears, throw our pains and feeling of helplessness and work towards something we're really good at.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">In 2006, with Thomas Hertog at CERN in Switzerland, Stephen Hawking proposed that the universe has no unique initial state, and that working outward to predict the current configuration of the universe from one particular state, such as in the Big Bang theory, contains a fallacy. Rather, Hawking's "top-down" cosmology says that in some ways, the present selects the past from a simultaneous superimposition of all the possible pasts.<br><br>
                                <br><br> The Big Bang theory says that the universe of matter and energy began at a single point, which reached a critical mass, then exploded outward. The universe continues to expand. In a closed universe theory, at some point, the universe is going to 'hit the wall,' when enough energy has been expended from the original big bang, then begin to shrink again. In an open universe theory, the universe will just continue to expand indefinitely as the force of gravity becomes weaker and weaker as objects in space spread further apart.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Hawking’s discovery that the area of a black hole also never decreases led the Mexican-Israeli physicist Jacob Bekenstein to suggest that in some way the area is the entropy of the black hole. The problem with this was that if a black hole has an entropy then it must have a temperature, and must therefore radiate heat – So it would no longer be black.<br> I think this is main invention towards university. </p>
